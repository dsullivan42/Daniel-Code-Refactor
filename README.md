# Daniel-Code-Refactor
My(Daniel's) First Challenge for Code Refactor 

For this challenge, I condensed the code given, and tried to remove any unnecessary code within the css file. For the html file, I changed all the tags to semantic tags, as well as removed code from the h1 tag, that was unnecessary in the code. I also needed to make a change to a class that should have been established as an element. I learned from this code how much difference condensing code can make, shortening the css file by almost half of it's length.
